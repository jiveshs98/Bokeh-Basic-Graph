# Bokeh-Basic-Graph
Basic bokeh graphs made using Bokeh library and Python 3.7 on Jupyter Notebook. 
<br></br>
&#8226; The code for line, triangle and circle graphs are in the **Basic_graph.ipynb** notebook.
<br></br>
&#8226; The code for creating multiple glyphs in one plot is in the **Multiple_Glyphs_in_one_plot.ipynb** notebook. 
<br></br><br></br>
An html file for every corresponding graph will be created after running the program. It is to be noted that this repository is for education purpose.
<br></br><br></br>
Snapshots of the graphs are given below:-
